Automation Action Contract:
Use ONLY these function names in returned JSON steps: sleep, moveto, click, write, press, hotkey (alias accepted: type -> write). Do NOT invent new function names; unsupported names will cause an error. If a behavior can't be expressed directly, decompose into allowed primitives.

JSON shape required:
{
	"steps": [ { "function": string, "parameters": { ... }, "human_readable_justification": string } ],
	"done": null | string
}
When complete: steps = [] and provide concise natural-language summary in done.
